            In the 21st century, with the advent of computer fonts, the terms "font" and "typeface" are often used interchangeably,<br> although the term "typeface" refers to the design of typographical lettering, whereas the term "font" refers<br> to the specific style of a typeface, such as its size and weight.<br> 
            For instance, the typeface "Bauer Bodoni" (sample shown here) includes fonts "Roman" (or "Regular"), "Bold" and "Italic"; each of these exists<br> in a variety of sizes.<br> 
            The term "font" is correctly applied to any one of these alone<br> but may be seen used loosely to refer to the whole typeface.<br>
