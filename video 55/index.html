        JavaScript (JS) is a versatile, high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily known for its role in web development. Here’s a broad overview of its features and uses:

        Key Characteristics
        Interpreted Language: JavaScript code is executed line-by-line by the browser’s JavaScript engine, rather than being compiled into machine code ahead of time.
        
        Dynamic Typing: Variables in JavaScript can hold values of any data type and can change type dynamically.
        
        Prototype-based: JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance instead of the classical inheritance model seen in languages like Java or C++. This means objects can directly inherit properties and methods from other objects.
        
        First-class Functions: Functions in JavaScript are objects that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This allows for functional programming patterns.
        
        Event-driven: JavaScript is well-suited for event-driven programming, making it powerful for user interface development and asynchronous programming.
